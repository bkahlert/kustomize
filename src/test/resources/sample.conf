            Song of the Witches: “Double, double toil and trouble”
            BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE
            (from Macbeth)
            Double, double toil and trouble;
            Fire burn and caldron bubble.
            Fillet of a fenny snake,
            In the caldron boil and bake;
            Eye of newt and toe of frog,
            Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
            Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
            Lizard's leg and howlet's wing,
            For a charm of powerful trouble,
            Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
            Double, double toil and trouble;
            Fire burn and caldron bubble.
            Cool it with a baboon's blood,
            Then the charm is firm and good.
