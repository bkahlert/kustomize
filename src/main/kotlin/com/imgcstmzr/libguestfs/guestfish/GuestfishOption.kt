     * If you donâ€™t know what filesystems a disk image contains, you can either run guestfish without this option,
     * then list the partitions, filesystems and LVs available (see [ListPartitionsOption], [ListFileSystemsOptions] and `lvs` commands),
     * or you can use the [virt-filesystems(1)](https://libguestfs.org/virt-filesystems.1.html) program.
     *
     * The third (and rarely used) part of the mount parameter is the list of mount [options]
     * used to mount the underlying filesystem.
     * If this is not given, then the mount options are either the empty string or ro (the latter if the [ReadOnlyOption] flag is used).
     *
     * By specifying the mount options, you override this default choice.
     * Probably the only time you would use this is to enable ACLs and/or extended attributes if the filesystem can support them
     * using `acl,user_xattr`
     *
     * The [fsType] parameter is the filesystem driver to use, such as `ext3` or `ntfs`.
     * This is rarely needed, but can be useful if multiple drivers are valid for a filesystem (eg: `ext2` and `ext3`),
     * or if libguestfs misidentifies a filesystem.
